# Hi, I'm Emir Canıtez 👋

Computer Science student at **Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Budapest**.  
I build **internship-ready** web projects and focus on **clean architecture, reliability, and documentation**.

- 💻 Main stack: **TypeScript/JavaScript, React/Next.js, NestJS, Prisma**
- 🧠 Strengths: **system thinking, clean code, refactoring, reproducible setups**
- 🎯 Target roles: **Frontend / Full-stack Intern (Web)**
- 🤝 Open to: **Erasmus collaboration, internship projects, team development**

## Flagship project
### **ValerPay** — Ledger-based payment workflow (Full-stack)
A demo payment platform modeling a real workflow: users create **deposit/withdraw** requests, admins **review/approve/complete** them, and balances are derived from an **append-only ledger** (DEBIT/CREDIT).

**What it proves**
- Domain workflow + state transitions (requests lifecycle)
- Role-based access (USER/ADMIN) with JWT
- Back-office admin operations + audit logs + reporting

➡️ Repo: `ValerPay` (pinned)  
➡️ Docs: architecture + API reference + seeded demo setup

## Featured work
- **cntzemir.github.io** — portfolio + project case studies  
- **javascript-exchange** — validation + logic focused JS project  
- **e-bike-rental-demo** — responsive UI practice with clean layout  
- **javascript-calculator** — fundamentals + refactoring practice

> I prefer fewer projects with stronger engineering signals: **docs, tests, CI, and clear demos**.

---

## Engineering habits (how I work)
- **Document-first**: README + setup + screenshots + decisions
- **Quality gates**: lint/build/test + CI
- **Iterative improvement**: refactor logs, commit hygiene, measurable changes
- **Reproducibility**: seed data + predictable local setup

---

## Learning focus
- Algorithms & problem solving (selected tasks documented)
- Backend fundamentals (API design, DB modeling, auth)
- Clean code & maintainability
